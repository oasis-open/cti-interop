<p>This GitHub public repository ( <b><a href="https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-interop">https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-interop</a></b> ) was created at the request of the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/cti/">OASIS Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) TC</a> as an <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/">OASIS TC Open Repository</a> to support development of open source resources related to Technical Committee work.</p>

<p>While this TC Open Repository remains associated with the sponsor TC, its development priorities, leadership, intellectual property terms, participation rules, and other matters of governance are <a href="https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-interop/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#governance-distinct-from-oasis-tc-process">separate and distinct</a> from the OASIS TC Process and related policies.</p>

<h2><a id="purposeStatement">Statement of Purpose</a></h2>

<p>Statement of Purpose for this OASIS TC Open Repository (<a href="https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-interop">cti-interop</a>) as <a href="https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/cti-interoperability/201805/msg00016.html">proposed</a> and <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/TCADMIN-3013">approved</a> by unanimous consent resolution process in the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/cti/">CTI TC</a>:</p>

<p>The purpose of this public GitHub repository is to address Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Interoperability issues, develop <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/62682/STIX-TAXII-SelfAttestProgram-Instructions-Draft.docx">STIXPreferred</a> test-data, and curate other STIXPreferred contributions useful to the program and its success, including participation from both CTI TC and non-TC members.</p>

<p>Draft resources from the OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cti-interoperability">CTI Interoperability Subcommittee</a> Chaired by Allan Thomson and Jason Keirstead introduce the STIXPreferred Self-Attestation Program, under development as of 2018-06.  The program initially is expected to cover "Structured Threat Information Expression Version 2 (<a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.0/">STIX2</a>)" and "Trusted Automated Exchange Of Indicator Information Version 2 (<a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.0/">TAXII2</a>)", developed within the OASIS CTI Technical Committee.</p>

<p>STIXPreferred Summary: "Software and data service providers who encode, share, use or transmit STIX/TAXII Version 2 data for other parties, as well as entities of any kind who use or transmit STIX/TAXII 2 for their own benefit (all 'Providers'), are encouraged to (a) use the CTI TC interoperability test documents that the OASIS CTI TC has published, in order to verify their product support  those tests, and (b) announce the successful completion of those tests as a self-attestation, using the 'OASIS STIX/TAXII 2 Preferred' Self-Attestation Program.  The Program accommodates the publication of self-attestation reports from Providers in a posted 'Preferred Providers' list on the OASIS website. The Self-Attestation Program is voluntary. However, all organizations providing Attestations to OASIS for potential addition to the Preferred Providers list are required to agree to the Program's <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/62681/STIX-TAXII-SelfAttestProgram-TermsOfUse-Draft.docx">Terms of Use</a>."</p>

<p>[<b>Staff Note:</b> On 'STIXPreferred', see provisionally also the Threat Intelligence Blog article <a href="https://www.lookingglasscyber.com/blog/why-cyber-response-mechanisms-must-talk-to-each-other-part-2/">"Why Cyber Response Mechanisms Must Talk to Each Other"</a>, by Allan Thomson. Excerpt: "The STIX Preferred program focuses on defined roles that products deployed in a security ecosystem can easily be matched against for verification. The STIX Preferred program defines those product roles as 'persona'... In addition to these personas, another key part of ensuring interoperability is a set of tests that define both expected data and expected behavior in as complete a set of scenarios as possible. Interoperability Key Tenants: Expected Data, Expected Behaviors, Completeness..." .]</p>

Allan Thomson (blog): STIX Preferred helps technology companies develop their products in a manner that ensures effective interoperability. This effort is being developed as part of the OASIS CTI Interoperability Subcommittee and is focused on business-driven use cases for interoperability of CTI products....

The STIX Preferred program focuses on defined roles that products deployed in a security ecosystem can easily be matched against for verification. The STIX Preferred program defines those product roles as 'persona'.

In addition to these personas, another key part of ensuring interoperability is a set of tests that define both expected data and expected behavior in as complete a set of scenarios as possible: Interoperability Key Tenants: Expected Data, Expected Behaviors, Completeness...

If you are an organization considering deploying STIX/TAXII version 2 based products to leverage CTI, I encourage you to consider researching and leveraging the STIX Preferred self-certified products as a basis for your evaluation. The STIX Preferred program will do a lot of the pre-validation of CTI products to consider during your product evaluation and assessment process.

If you are a vendor considering building STIX/TAXII version 2 based products to exchange CTI, consider self-certification of your products.
